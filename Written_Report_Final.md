# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project aims to analyze the probability of success for kickstarters in the theater category, based on seasonality and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
My analysis for this project was made using excel dataset of historical kickstarters, and using sorting functions to filter the data I needed. 


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One main challenge that I encountered was the introduction of new functions in excel such as countifs(). It was more complicated than most other functions introduced in the bootcamp so far. Looking at the documentation for the functions helped me overcome this challenge.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. The most successful time to launch a theater kickstarter is in the May - June period.
2. The least successful time to launch a theater kickstarter is in the December - January period.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

There are very few plays with kickstarter goals above $45000 that were successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The main limitation of this dataset is that the sample size for several of these goal ranges is small relative to others. For example, there are 534 total projects with goals between $1000 and $4999, but only 16 projects with goals above $50000. Because of the small sample sizes, the percentage value can wildly fluctuate and is not the best way to look at the data.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
